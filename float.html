        HIGHEST NUMBER OF OFFICIAL LANGUAGES
        India has 22 official languages. The eighth schedule of the Indian constitution lists the official languages. It originally included 14 languages.
        Subsequently, Sindhi was added in 1967 by the 21st amendment. In 1992, Konkani, Meitei (Manipuri) and Nepali languages were included by the 71st amendment. Four more languages – Bodo, Dogri, Maithili and Santhali were added in 2003 by the 92nd amendment.

            STATUE OF UNITY
            India is famous for hosting the world’s tallest statue, known as the Statue of Unity. The 597 ft (182 m) high statue is the sculpture of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, an eminent freedom fighter and the first Home Minister of independent India. 

            The Statue of Unity is twice the size of New York’s Statue of Liberty. It was unveiled on October 31, 2018, to commemorate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
